# UI Main Layout Design - Spotify-Inspired Redesign

## GOALS/VISION

### End-state UI: how it works

- **Top Bar (Section 0)**
  - Global, full-width bar with Org switcher/Back, navigation, global search, notifications, and a profile menu.
  - Never contains screen-specific controls.

- **Left Sidebar (Section A)**
  - Two states: open (≈280px) and collapsed icon rail (64px). Collapsed rail always visible with tooltips.
  - Independent from the right sidebar; width and state persist.

- **Center (Section B)**
  - Primary content area. Uses a clear two-row control system:
    - Section control bar (top): tabs/“+” and section expand button (top-right).
    - Screen control bar (below, optional): screen-specific actions like Filters/Display. No global search/bell here.

- **Right Sidebar (Section C)**
  - Mirrors A's independence and persistence. Can be open/hidden (later may support 'collapsed' parity).

- **Bottom Bar (Section D)**
  - Full-width global bar. Above it is an adjustable split area (0-50% viewport height) controlled by a draggable handle and keyboard.
  - Height persists and restores without jank.

- **Fullscreen per-section**
  - Expands A/B/C to fill the viewport visually. Top/Bottom bars hide; other sidebars zero out via CSS vars (original states preserved). Exit restores exact prior states.

- **Tabs and Screen Selector**
  - Each section A/B/C can host multiple tabs with persistence. A "+" opens a searchable Screen Selector backed by a typed registry.
  - Tabs swap screens without affecting control bar placement.

- **State, performance, and accessibility**
  - Layout driven by CSS variables; persisted states versioned in storage.
  - Animations smooth, reduced for `prefers-reduced-motion`; drag interactions disable transitions during drag.
  - Accessible roles, labels, tooltips, focus management, and keyboard support on interactive elements.

### High-level goals

- **Global chrome clarity**: Separate global controls (Top Bar) from section and screen controls to reduce clutter and misplacement.
- **Predictable structure**: Three-row app shell and three-panel main grid that behave consistently across screens.
- **Iterative evolution**: Feature flags and granular steps allow frequent merges and safe rollouts.
- **Resilient persistence**: Sidebars and bottom split restore exactly as before, including during fullscreen transitions.
- **Accessibility by default**: Roles, keyboard paths, and readable labels built into each slice.
- **Performance first**: Avoid layout thrash; use CSS vars; restore persisted layout without CLS.

### Vision

A Spotify-inspired, modern workspace where navigation and global context live in a sleek Top Bar, primary focus remains in the center, rails stay usable even when collapsed, and a utility Bottom Bar provides a flexible canvas for logs, timelines, or future features. The layout is predictable, accessible, and fast, with stateful, independent sections that can be expanded or rearranged without breaking flow. Tabs and a typed screen registry make any screen loadable into any section, paving the way for saved "Views," keyboard shortcuts, and AI-driven layout commands.

## TASK LIST

### Iterative micro-iterations and acceptance checklists

### Phase 1: TopBar
- [x] TopBar renders above all content and spans full width.
- [x] Contains items previously in LeftSidebar top section (OrgSwitcher/BackToApp).
- [x] Integrates existing header-nav functionality (search, notifications).
- [x] Profile circle placeholder is present on the right side.
- [ ] Main layout structure updated to accommodate TopBar (pending feature flag + CSS variable pass).
#### Updated Phase 1 Completion Plan
1. Implement the `enableTopBar` feature flag gate, leveraging the "Feature Flags" mitigation in Safe Deployment Strategy to allow instant rollback if regressions surface.
2. Introduce shared layout CSS variables for heights and rails, aligning with the "Graceful Degradation" mitigation so the layout falls back cleanly when variables are unsupported.
3. Expand reduced-motion handling and token polish, guided by the "Reduced Motion Conflicts" mitigation and ensuring accessibility checks pass before deployment.
4. Run the acceptance testing checklist with logging through existing error boundaries, echoing the "Error Boundaries" mitigation to capture regressions before release.
### Phase 2: Left Sidebar icon-rail
**Status**: 2.1 complete; 2.2+ pending CSS variable work
- [x] 2.1 State model refactor (non-visual) (completed)
  - `leftState: 'open' | 'collapsed'` added with safe defaults
  - Persistence keys added without breaking current state
  - No user-facing changes yet
- 2.2 CSS vars + grid readiness
  - `--left-open`, `--left-collapsed`, `--left-width` in place
  - Grid columns read from vars; still behaves as “open” by default
  - No layout jank on load
- 2.3 Render collapsed rail visuals
  - 64px rail renders behind `enableLeftRail`
  - Icons align vertically; no text visible
  - Rail z-index prevents overlap from content
- 2.4 Toggle wiring
  - Toggle switches `open` ↔ `collapsed` smoothly
  - Text fades out on collapse; returns on open
  - No content reflow beyond intended width change
- 2.5 Tooltips and focus
  - Icons have `aria-label`; tooltips on hover/focus
  - Keyboard navigation reaches all icons in collapsed state
  - Screen reader announces labels correctly
- 2.6 Transitions and performance
  - Width/text transitions are smooth; disabled during drag
  - No layout thrashing (only CSS transitions on vars)
  - Reduced motion respected
- 2.7 Remove old “hidden” pathway (cleanup)
  - All codepaths for “hidden” removed/redirected
  - Right sidebar unaffected
  - Persistence migration leaves users in valid states

### Phase 3: BottomBar + split
- 3.1 BottomBar shell behind a flag
  - BottomBar renders with `role="contentinfo"` when `enableBottomSplit` is true
  - `--bottombar-height` defined and applied
  - No change when flag is off
- 3.2 Main-area split scaffolding
  - Middle row uses `--center-bottom-split`; default 0px
  - No additional scrollbars or CLS introduced
  - Works with right sidebar open/closed
- 3.3 Split handle component (static)
  - Handle visible above BottomBar; accessible hit area
  - Cursor changes on hover; hover/active states visible
  - No drag behavior yet
- 3.4 State wiring
  - `centerBottomSplit` state (0px up to ~50% viewport height) with setter works
  - Dev control can change the value and updates layout live
  - No transition during change (until 3.6)
- 3.5 Drag behavior
  - Mouse drag adjusts split within bounds; stops on mouseup/leave
  - Transitions disabled during drag, re-enabled after
  - No text selection or scroll fights during drag
- 3.6 Persistence
  - `ui:centerBottomSplit` persisted and restored
  - First-paint height matches persisted value without jank
  - Safe defaults when localStorage is unavailable
- 3.7 Keyboard accessibility
  - Handle has `role="separator"` and `aria-orientation="horizontal"`
  - Arrow keys adjust height in 4–8px steps with bounds
  - Focus visible; ESC leaves focus cleanly
- 3.8 Visual polish
  - Handle visual aligns with design (shadow, grip, etc.)
  - Works in touch environments (no hover-only affordances)
  - Reduced motion respected

#### Bottom Bar Mode Toggle (Section D)
- Simplified label: `Overlay Mode`
- Behavior: Only "Overlay Mode" is interactive; acts as on/off toggle
  - When Overlay Mode is bold, overlay is active
  - Clicking bold Overlay Mode turns it off (returns to Push, the default)
  - Push is implied default and non-interactive text
 - Visual states:
   - Default: `text-muted-foreground`
   - Hover: `hover:bg-muted/20 hover:text-foreground`
   - Active: `bg-blue-500 text-white font-medium` (matches drag handle blue-500)

### Phase 4: Cleanup and enhancements
- 4.1 Remove duplicate left toggle from sidebar header
  - Only the intended global toggle remains
  - No orphaned styles/handlers
  - Future keyboard shortcut maps to the remaining toggle
- 4.2 Move demo user dropdown into profile menu
  - All existing actions appear in the TopBar profile menu
  - No change to auth/session behavior
  - Tab order remains logical
- 4.3 Section vs Screen control bar audit
  - Expand icon only in Section control bars (A/B/C)
  - Screen bars (e.g., Projects) keep Filter/Display only
  - No global bell/search in Section or Screen bars
- 4.4 Accessibility audit pass
  - All interactive elements have roles/names; tooltip timing OK
  - Focus return after closing menus and fullscreen behaves correctly
  - No keyboard traps
- 4.5 Animations polish
  - Consistent easing/duration across layout changes
  - Drag disables transitions globally; restored after
  - No flicker in dark/light transitions
- 4.6 Final QA checklist
  - Expand B restores A/C rails and BottomBar height precisely
  - Tabs (if present) don’t shift Section control bar layout
  - No layout jank or scroll glitches across routes

## Recommended additions and risk guardrails

- Design tokens and theming
  - Define spacing, radii, color roles for Top/Bottom bars and rails
  - Tokenize heights, widths, gutters, and z-index layers
- z-index layering map
  - Document stacking contexts for TopBar, Screen bars, rails, menus, tooltips, split handle
- SSR/hydration safety
  - Guard localStorage reads; match server-rendered CSS var defaults
- Touch and mobile behavior
  - Drag handle touch events; tooltip fallbacks without hover
  - Breakpoint rules for hiding rails while keeping toggles accessible
- Persistence versioning/migrations
  - Version key for layout state; migrate legacy `hidden` → `collapsed`
- Testing strategy
  - Unit tests for state selectors; E2E for toggles/split/restore
  - Visual snapshots for Top/Bottom bars and collapsed rail
- Performance and budgets
  - Throttle drag handlers; avoid reflow-heavy operations
  - Measure CLS/LCP after TopBar/BottomBar integration
- Analytics/telemetry (optional)
  - Track usage of toggles and split adjustments
- i18n/RTL readiness
  - Validate icon alignment and labels in RTL
- Error/loading and skeletons
  - TopBar controls degrade gracefully if user/data is loading
- Keyboard shortcuts spec (future)
  - Reserve bindings for toggles, focus, expand; document conflicts
- Documentation
  - Short contributor README for feature flags, CSS vars, and state model

# UI Main Layout Design - Spotify-Inspired Redesign

> **IMPORTANT:** Implement ONE PHASE AT A TIME for review. After each phase completion, we will discuss the plan for the next phase.

## DETAILS

### Overview

This document outlines the complete redesign of the main layout to match a Spotify-inspired interface with full-width top and bottom bars, ChatGPT-style collapsible left sidebar, and a draggable bottom split area.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Layout Structure
- Three-panel layout with resizable left/right sidebars
- Headers embedded within the main content area
- Left sidebar with header section containing `OrgSwitcher`/`BackToApp` and a toggle button
- Right sidebar trigger in the top navigation area
- No dedicated top/bottom bars spanning full width

### Screenshot Analysis (main-layout-ui.jpg)
From the Spotify-inspired wireframe provided:
- **Top Bar (Section 0)**: Full-width dark header with navigation controls, search, and profile area
- **Left Sidebar**: Collapsed to icon-only state (like ChatGPT), showing vertical icons
- **Main Content**: Central content area with its own header
- **Right Sidebar**: Visible on the far right
- **Bottom Bar**: Full-width footer with what appears to be a drag handle above it

### Issues to Resolve
1. **Duplicate Left Sidebar Toggles**: Currently two toggle buttons exist (one in sidebar header, one in content header)
2. **No Global Navigation**: Headers are embedded in content instead of spanning full width
3. **Complete Sidebar Hide**: Left sidebar completely disappears when collapsed instead of icon-only rail
4. **No Bottom Bar**: Missing global status area and draggable split functionality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create TopBar Component and Move Header Functionality
**Status**: In progress - TopBar live, feature flag and CSS variable integration outstanding

**Objective**: Create a full-width TopBar that spans above the three-panel layout and consolidate existing header functionality.

**Completed**:
1. Created `components/layout/top-bar.tsx`.
2. Moved `OrgSwitcher`/`BackToApp` from left sidebar header to TopBar.
3. Integrated existing header-nav functionality (search, notifications, profile stub) into the TopBar.
4. Removed legacy duplicates from section headers.

**Still Needed**:
1. Add `enableTopBar` feature flag and update layout gating.
2. Convert layout heights to shared CSS variables and update grid helpers.
3. Finish reduced-motion coverage and visual polish before enabling flag by default.
### Phase 2: Icon-Only Left Sidebar Collapse
**Objective**: Change left sidebar collapse behavior to ChatGPT-style icon rail instead of complete hiding.

**Tasks**:
1. Modify sidebar collapse logic to support 'collapsed' vs 'open' (remove 'hidden')
2. Implement 64px icon-only rail with tooltips
3. Add smooth text fade animations
4. Update state management for new collapse behavior

### Phase 3: BottomBar with Draggable Split
**Objective**: Add full-width bottom bar with adjustable split area above it.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `components/layout/bottom-bar.tsx`
2. Implement draggable split handle component
3. Add state management for center-bottom-split (0-50% viewport height)
4. Add keyboard accessibility for split adjustment

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Enhancement
**Objective**: Remove duplicate controls, enhance profile menu, and polish interactions.

**Tasks**:
1. Remove duplicate left sidebar toggle from sidebar header
2. Move demo user dropdown into profile circle menu
3. Polish animations and accessibility
4. Final testing and refinement

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. App Shell Structure Redesign
**Current**: Single grid with three panels
**New**: Three-row layout with TopBar, MainArea, BottomBar

```css
.app-shell {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 56px 1fr 56px; /* TopBar, MainArea, BottomBar */
}
```

### 2. TopBar Implementation
**Purpose**: Global navigation and controls spanning full width

**Content Migration**:
- **From Left Sidebar Header**: Move `OrgSwitcher`/`BackToApp` to TopBar left section
- **From Current Headers**: Integrate existing header-nav functionality
- **Add**: Profile circle menu on the right side

**Structure**:
```
TopBar Layout:
[App Logo] [OrgSwitcher] [Navigation] [Center Search] [Notifications] [Profile Circle]
```

**Components to Create**:
- `components/layout/top-bar.tsx` - Main TopBar component
- Move demo user dropdown into profile circle menu (Phase 4)

#### 2.1 Terminology and Contracts: Section vs Screen Control Bars (completed)
**Goal**: Prevent feature drift and keep controls consistent across Sections A/B/C and any loaded screen.

- **Section control bar (A/B/C)**: The top-most bar inside each section. Owns section-level controls only.
  - Contains: tabs (or just a “+” and title when only one tab), section title, and the section’s expand icon (top-right).
  - Does NOT contain: global search, notification bell, or screen-specific filters.
- **Screen control bar (per-screen, optional)**: Renders immediately below the Section control bar when the loaded screen provides one.
  - Contains: screen-specific actions such as Filter, Display, view modes, screen-local search if that screen defines its own narrow-scoped search (not global search).
  - Never contains: section expand, global search, or global notifications.

Specifics for Section B (currently showing Projects):
- The expand icon belongs to the top Section control bar (not the Projects bar).
- The Projects Filter/Display controls remain in the Screen control bar below the Section control bar.
- The notification bell has been removed from Section B’s bars; global bell remains in Section 0 (Top Bar).
- Global search is in Section 0 (Top Bar) at the right, not in Section B.

Layout guidance for Section control bar:
- Left: tabs or a single “+” and section title when only one tab exists.
- Right: section expand icon (top-right alignment is required).

Quality checks:
- Expand icon appears only in the Section control bar for A/B/C.
- If a screen has its own control bar, it renders exactly one row below the Section control bar.

### 3. Left Sidebar Icon-Only Collapse
**Current**: Completely hides when collapsed
**New**: ChatGPT-style icon rail (64px width)

**Implementation Details**:
- **Collapsed State**: 64px width with icons only, no text labels
- **Open State**: 280px width with full content
- **Transition**: Smooth width animation with text fade
- **Tooltips**: Show on hover when collapsed

**State Management Updates**:
```typescript
type LeftState = 'open' | 'collapsed'; // Remove 'hidden' state
const COLLAPSED_WIDTH = 64;
```

### 4. BottomBar with Draggable Split
**Purpose**: Global status area with resizable content above

**Features**:
- Full-width bottom bar (56px height)
- Draggable split handle above BottomBar
- Adjustable space (0-50% viewport height) for future features (logs, timeline, etc.)
- Keyboard accessible with arrow key controls

**CSS Variables**:
```css
:root {
  --center-bottom-split: 0px; /* Adjustable split height */
  --bottombar-height: 56px;
}
```

### 5. Remove Duplicate Left Sidebar Toggle
**Problem**: Two toggle buttons (one in sidebar header, one in content header)
**Solution**: Keep only the one in the top-left corner of MainContent area, remove the one from sidebar header

### 6. Expand / Fullscreen Behavior (Sections A/B/C)
**Objective**: A one-click expand for any section that hides global chrome visually but preserves state for restoration.

- Introduce `fullscreenSection: null | 'A' | 'B' | 'C'` in layout provider.
- When `fullscreenSection` is set:
  - Hide Section 0 (Top Bar) and Section D (Bottom Bar) visually by driving CSS variables (do not mutate their persisted settings).
  - Visually set other sections’ widths to 0 using CSS variables only; do not change A/C `isOpen` or `preferredWidth`.
  - Remove container borders/radius for the expanded section’s main container so it truly fills the viewport.
- On exit (set `fullscreenSection = null`):
  - Restore previous CSS variable widths and show Section 0/D again.
  - A/C sidebars return to their prior widths/open state from persistence.

Quality checks:
- Toggling expand on B does not erase A/C widths or states.
- Bottom bar returns to the precise prior height/mode after exit.
- Keyboard focus remains within the expanded section and returns gracefully on exit.

### 7. Tabs and Screen Selector (Sections A/B/C)
**Objective**: Load any screen into any section using tabs.

- Tabs per section with persistence: `tabs: Record<'A'|'B'|'C', ScreenTab[]>`, `activeTab: Record<'A'|'B'|'C', string|null>`.
- Single-tab UX: show only a “+” at far-left plus section title; no visible tab strip.
- Multiple tabs UX: visible tabs with close buttons and an always-visible “+” at far-left.
- Screen Selector modal (opens on “+”): pre-selects the clicked section, searchable registry of screens (id, label, icon, component).
- Avoid global controls in tabs; tabs only switch screens for the section.

Quality checks:
- Creating, closing, and switching tabs do not alter Section control bar contents/placement.
- Projects screen shows its Screen control bar beneath the Section control bar when active.

#### 7.1 Screen Registry (Central Catalog)
The Screen Selector reads from a typed registry of all screens that can be loaded into A/B/C. This keeps discovery, loading, and UX consistent.

Type shape:
```ts
export type ScreenId =
  | 'issues' | 'features' | 'roadmap' | 'projects' | 'teams'
  | 'members' | 'inbox' | 'ai-chat' | 'unit-tests' | 'flows';

export interface ScreenDefinition {
  id: ScreenId;
  label: string;
  icon?: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
  // Prefer lazy loading to keep initial bundle small
  load: () => Promise<{ default: React.ComponentType<any> }>;
  hasScreenControlBar?: boolean; // e.g., Projects, Issues
  keywords?: string[]; // Modal search
  enabled?: boolean; // Feature flag
}

export const screenRegistry: Record<ScreenId, ScreenDefinition> = {
  projects: {
    id: 'projects',
    label: 'Projects',
    icon: ProjectsIcon,
    load: () => import('@/components/screens/projects-screen'),
    hasScreenControlBar: true,
    keywords: ['board', 'initiatives', 'plans'],
    enabled: true,
  },
  issues: {
    id: 'issues',
    label: 'Issues',
    icon: IssuesIcon,
    load: () => import('@/components/screens/issues-screen'),
    hasScreenControlBar: true,
    keywords: ['bugs', 'tickets'],
    enabled: true,
  },
  // ...others
};
```

Notes:
- Unique `id` values enable stable tab persistence and restoration.
- `hasScreenControlBar` determines whether to render a Screen control bar below the Section control bar.
- Use `keywords` for modal search quality; use `enabled` for gradual rollout.

### 8. Sidebars A/C Collapsed Rail Spec (Predictable, independent)
**Objective**: Ensure reliable collapsed rails that are always visible and independent of loaded content.

- Collapsed width: maintain a minimal, consistent rail (e.g., 64px) across A and C.
- The rail must always display the open/close trigger and icons with tooltips.
- Content from any screen must not overlap the rail; enforce via z-index and container padding where necessary.
- A and C operate independently; toggling one never mutates the other.
- Persistence: remember `isOpen`, `width`, and `preferredWidth` per side.

Quality checks:
- With arbitrary screens loaded, the rail remains visible and interactive.
- Resizing works only when open; rails remain fixed-width when collapsed.

### 9. State Model and CSS Variables (Contract)
**Canonical CSS variables** (set on `:root`):
- `--sidebar-left-width`, `--sidebar-right-width`, `--grid-template-columns`, `--bottombar-height`.
- Fullscreen drives visual zeroing via these variables; it does not overwrite persisted store values.

Persistence keys:
- Left/Right: open, width, preferredWidth.
- Bottom bar: mode, height, visibility, overlay position (as applicable).
- Optionally: `fullscreenSection` if persistence is desired (otherwise session-only).

Quality checks:
- On reload, sidebars and bottom bar restore from persistence without layout jank.
- Reduced motion preference respected for transitions.

### 10. Top Bar (Section 0) Specifics
- Global search is on the right side of Section 0 (Top Bar). The old center search is removed.
- Global notifications remain on the right in Section 0.
- Section B (and others) must not reintroduce global search or bell in their bars.

### 11. Animations and Timing
- Grid column transitions: 200–300ms ease-in-out.
- Sidebar drag disables transitions while dragging; re-enable after mouseup.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` to minimize or disable animations.

### 12. Responsive and Accessibility
- Responsive: on small screens, rails may hide under a breakpoint-specific rule, but toggles must remain accessible (e.g., Top Bar triggers).
- Accessibility: roles for Top Bar (`banner`), Bottom Bar (`contentinfo`), split handle (`separator` + `aria-orientation`), tooltips with `aria-label`.
- Keyboard shortcuts (future phase): toggles for A/C and expand per section; ensure focus management when entering/exiting fullscreen.

### 13. Cross-Feature QA Checklist
- Expand B while A is collapsed: rails remain visible; exit restores correctly.
- Expand with Bottom Bar in push/overlay modes and non-zero height: exit restores exact height/mode.
- Switch tabs in B while expanded: no layout shift in Section control bar; Screen control bar changes appropriately.
- Load a screen without a Screen control bar: only Section control bar is visible; layout does not shift vertically.

### 14. Context from Feature Ideas (Alignment)
This layout plan aligns with the broader goals captured in the feature ideas document and brings forward the minimal context needed to keep implementation coherent:

- Views and Settings integration (future phases):
  - A settings UI will expose Section enable/disable, Views create/save/access, default view selection, and keyboard shortcut customization.
  - The layout should keep state shape compatible with future Views (e.g., tabs per section, activeTab, sectionVisibility, widths) to allow saving/restoring.

- Keyboard shortcuts (roadmap):
  - Global: toggle left/right sidebars; focus sections; expand/exit fullscreen for A/B/C; quick open Screen Selector.
  - Ensure focus management and ARIA roles added above are compatible with future shortcut handling.

- AI layout control (roadmap):
  - Natural-language commands (e.g., “show Issues in right sidebar”, “expand Section B”) should map to the same provider APIs (`setLeftSidebarOpen`, `setRightSidebarOpen`, `setFullscreenSection`, tab operations).
  - Keep provider APIs deterministic and idempotent to support AI-driven flows.

- Screen registry (for Screen Selector):
  - Define a typed registry listing screens the user can load into any section (Issues, Features, Roadmap, Projects, Teams, Members, Inbox, AI Chat, Unit Tests, Flows, etc.).
  - Each entry includes: `id`, `label`, `icon`, `component`, and optional `hasScreenControlBar` flag.

- Naming of layout areas (reference):
  - Section 0 (Top Bar), A (Left), B (Center), C (Right), D (Bottom). This doc’s terminology and control-bar contracts reflect that model.

Quality checks:
- Provider state and UI contracts remain compatible with saving/loading Views.
- Shortcuts and AI can call the same provider APIs without special cases.

### 6. Content Layout Updates
**MainArea Structure**:
```
MainArea (middle row of app-shell):
├── main-grid (contains 3 panels)
│   ├── LeftSidebar (icon-only when collapsed)
│   ├── MainContent
│   └── RightSidebar
├── split-handle (draggable)
└── [adjustable space above BottomBar]
```

### 7. CSS Grid Variables System
```css
:root {
  --left-open: 280px;
  --left-collapsed: 64px;
  --right-open: 320px;
  --right-hidden: 0px;
  --topbar-height: 56px;
  --bottombar-height: 56px;
  --center-bottom-split: 0px;
}

.main-grid {
  grid-template-columns: var(--left-width) 1fr var(--right-width);
  transition: grid-template-columns 200ms ease;
}
```

### 8. Profile Menu Enhancement
**Migration**: Move demo user dropdown from its current location into the profile circle menu
**New Structure**: Profile circle opens menu containing:
- User profile options
- Demo user switcher (relocated)
- Account settings
- Sign out

### 9. State Management Updates
**ResizableSidebarProvider Enhancements**:
- Add `centerBottomSplit` state (0-50% viewport-derived range)
- Add `setCenterBottomSplit` function
- Add localStorage persistence for split height
- Update left sidebar states to remove 'hidden', add 'collapsed'

### 10. Accessibility Implementation
- TopBar: `role="banner"`
- BottomBar: `role="contentinfo"`
- Split handle: `role="separator"` with `aria-orientation="horizontal"`
- Icon tooltips: `aria-label` for collapsed sidebar icons
- Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys for split adjustment

const [leftState, setLeftState] = useState<LeftState>('open');
const [rightState, setRightState] = useState<RightState>('hidden');
const [centerBottomSplit, setCenterBottomSplit] = useState(0);
```

### CSS Grid Layout
```css
.app-shell {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: var(--topbar-height) 1fr var(--bottombar-height);
}

.main-area {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr var(--center-bottom-split);
  height: 100%;
}

.main-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:
    var(--left-width) var(--gutter) 1fr var(--gutter) var(--right-width);
  height: 100%;
  transition: grid-template-columns 200ms ease;
}
```

### Persistence
All layout states will be persisted to localStorage:
- `ui:leftState`
- `ui:leftWidth`
- `ui:rightState`
- `ui:rightWidth`
- `ui:centerBottomSplit`

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Split height persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility for split adjustment
- ✅ Range: 0-50% viewport-height adjustable space

### Phase 4: Polish & Cleanup
- ✅ Single left sidebar toggle (duplicate removed)
- ✅ Demo user dropdown moved to profile circle menu
- ✅ All animations smooth and performant
- ✅ No layout jank or scroll issues
- ✅ Full accessibility compliance

### Global (Cross-Feature)
- ✅ Section vs Screen control bars are distinct: expand icon only in Section control bars (top-right), screen actions only in Screen control bars below.
- ✅ Section B uses two bars correctly: Section (top) with expand; Projects screen bar (bottom) with Filter/Display; no bell/search in Section B.
- ✅ A/C collapsed rails: fixed minimal width, always visible, triggers accessible, independent behavior.
- ✅ Fullscreen: `fullscreenSection` hides Section 0/D visually, zeroes other sections via CSS vars, and restores prior widths/modes on exit.
- ✅ Tabs: single-tab “+” behavior, modal screen selector, persistence, no interference with Section control bar layout.
 - ✅ Layout state compatible with future Views, keyboard shortcuts, and AI control.

# 🛡️ Vercel Compatibility & Deployment Validation

## Overview
This layout system is designed from the ground up for Vercel deployment with comprehensive compatibility checks and production-ready optimizations.

## 🚀 Vercel-Specific Quality Checks

### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Safety**
- [ ] All layout components render correctly without JavaScript
- [ ] No hydration mismatches between server and client
- [ ] CSS variables have proper fallbacks for SSR
- [ ] State initialization doesn't break server rendering

### **Performance & Bundle Optimization**
- [ ] Layout components use lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] CSS variables don't cause layout thrashing
- [ ] Transitions are disabled during initial load
- [ ] Bundle size impact is minimal (<50KB gzipped)

### **Edge Runtime Compatibility**
- [ ] All layout logic works with Vercel's edge runtime
- [ ] No Node.js-specific APIs used in layout components
- [ ] localStorage access is safely guarded
- [ ] Web APIs (ResizeObserver, etc.) have fallbacks

### **CDN & Asset Optimization**
- [ ] Icons and images load from Vercel's global CDN
- [ ] Static assets are optimized for global delivery
- [ ] No blocking resources during layout initialization
- [ ] Fonts load without causing layout shift

### **Database & Persistence**
- [ ] localStorage operations have proper error handling
- [ ] Layout state persists correctly across deployments
- [ ] No data loss during state migration
- [ ] Fallbacks when localStorage is unavailable

## 🔍 Conflict Prevention & Integration Points

### **Potential Conflicts to Avoid**

#### **1. CSS Variable Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Existing CSS variables might conflict with layout system
- **Mitigation**: Use unique prefixes (`--layout-`, `--heyspex-layout-`)
- **Check**: Ensure no existing variables are overwritten

#### **2. Event Listener Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Layout system might interfere with existing keyboard/mouse handlers
- **Mitigation**: Use event delegation and proper cleanup
- **Check**: Test with existing drag-and-drop and keyboard shortcut systems

#### **3. Z-Index Layer Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Layout components might appear behind existing modals/overlays
- **Mitigation**: Document and maintain z-index hierarchy
- **Check**: Ensure layout components don't interfere with existing UI

#### **4. State Management Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Layout state might conflict with existing Zustand stores
- **Mitigation**: Use isolated store with clear separation
- **Check**: Ensure layout state doesn't affect existing application state

## 🐛 Known Issues & Mitigations

### **Potential Issues Identified**
1. **localStorage Unavailable**: Fallback to session storage or in-memory state
2. **Reduced Motion Conflicts**: Respect user preferences with CSS media queries
3. **Touch Device Issues**: Provide touch-friendly alternatives to hover states
4. **Slow Network Conditions**: Progressive loading and offline fallbacks

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality works without advanced features
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Advanced features load when available
- **Error Boundaries**: Layout components wrapped in error boundaries
- **Fallback UI**: Simple alternatives when features fail to load
