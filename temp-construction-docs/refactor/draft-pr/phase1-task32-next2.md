# Draft PR ï¿½ Phase 1 Test Stabilization (phase1-task32-next2)

## Summary

- Deep-clone members and projects fixtures, add store-level reset APIs, and expose explicit test helpers so Zustand state no longer bleeds between specs.
- Promote the command palette regression script to a first-class Vitest suite and align selector UX/tests ("No Project" placeholder, multi-node assertions).
- Capture preflight evidence (typecheck, lint, tests, build) and document rollback steps to unblock draft review of Phase 1 stabilization.

- Build: `temp-construction-docs/refactor/evidence/phase1-task32-next2/build.log`
- Preflight JSON records: `temp-construction-docs/refactor/preflight/phase1-task32-next2.json`
