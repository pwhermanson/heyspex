1. Phase 1 stabilization delivered green test suites enabling confidence in the refactor rollout.
2. Validating evidence and rollback steps now ensures reviewers can approve safely without surprises.
3. No new regressions or blockers surfaced since the last plan update; the branch remains focused on test hardening.
4. Outstanding risk is residual Next.js build crash history, mitigated by fresh build logs captured in this pass.
5. If instability reappears we should pause approval, address the build crash, and refresh this evidence package.
