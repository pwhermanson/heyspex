# UI/Layout Feature Ideas

## Control Layout Options - in settings
	### Accessible by clicking on settings option in settings menu
	### Accessible by keyboard shortcut (this is configurable under keyboard shortcut settings)
	### Enable or Disable a Section
	### Create/Save/Access Views
		#### Set a default view
	
## LLM AI Integration
	### Control the layout with chat
## Control the layout with keyboard
## Control the layout with settings
	### Customize keyboard settings
	### Views
		#### Views settings screen can only be accessed from the settings menu
		#### Can access views from the main sidebar - which opens settings sidebar (if user-enabled)
		#### Views can be saved as shortcuts
		#### Graphic showing layout, and user can enable or disable sections
		#### Views can be associated to keyboard shortcuts
	### Menus
		#### User can control what shows on what menus
			##### User can enable or disable settings items to show in "settings" shortcut section on the main sidebar


## Need to figure out the best way to enable a user to view different screens on different areas from the main UI screen and not from settings.  Idea is to use tabs, like Cursor. Click a + sign or "views" icon like linear.app to add a new screen into a section.  The active tab is what is showing. Modal pops up to add a window to the area.  The modal can be used to add any screen to any section. The section is pre-selected with section from which the + sign is associated that the user clicked on. If user clicks on + sign in Section B, then the modal pops up with Section B pre-filled. Autocomplete search box at top enables for quick search for the user's desired screen.  Browse function for all screens available.

	### Any items can be loaded on any of the 4 sections
		#### AI Chat window
		#### Main menu
				##### typically would be a sidebar menu
		#### Settings menu
				##### typically would be a sidebar menu
		#### Unit Tests
		#### Inbox
		#### Flows screen
		#### Issues (pre-made view of kanban board / list of bugs or issues that need to be addressed)
		#### Features (pre-made view of kanban board / list of all features to be added)
		#### Roadmap (pre-made view of kanban board / list of all features, issues and any other item-types to be added)

## Naming of Layout Areas
	Since each section can be configured, dragged, removed, expanded, and collapsed, the sections are all easily configurable to be almost any size, so any screen can be loaded in any section. Almost like you have a monitor on your desktop and want to view 3 windows at once. Plus an additional horizontal space at the bottom and top bar.
	### Top Bar = Top Bar
	### Left "sidebar" = Section A (Expandable/Collapsible)
	### Middle content area = Section B (Expandable/Collapsible)
	### Right "sidebar" = Section C (Expandable/Collapsible)
	### Bottom content area = Section D (Two modes available)
		#### Section D - Push (Expandable/Collapsible - pushes content up)
		#### Section D - Overlay (Expandable/Collapsible - overlays on content)

	
Theme Options
	## Enable/Disable Title highlights in List or Board views (that correspond with icon colors)
