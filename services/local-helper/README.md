# Local Helper

Reserved for the thin local helper that brokers between HeySpex and MCP.

This service will act as a lightweight bridge between the main HeySpex application and the MCP server, handling local operations and providing a clean interface for MCP communication.

## Planned Features

- Local file system operations
- MCP server communication
- Data transformation and validation
- Error handling and logging

## Status

Currently in planning phase. Implementation will begin when MCP requirements are finalized.
