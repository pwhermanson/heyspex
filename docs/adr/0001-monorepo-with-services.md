# ADR-0001: Monorepo Architecture with Service Boundaries

## Status

Accepted

## Context

HeySpex is a project management and issue tracking application that needs to scale from a single developer to a team. The application consists of multiple interconnected features including issue management, team collaboration, project organization, and user management.

## Decision

We will use a monorepo architecture with clear service boundaries, organizing code by feature domains rather than technical layers.

## Rationale

### Benefits of Monorepo Approach

1. **Simplified Development Workflow**

   - Single repository to clone and set up
   - Unified dependency management with pnpm
   - Consistent tooling and configuration across all services
   - Atomic commits across related changes

2. **Code Reuse and Consistency**

   - Shared UI components in `components/ui/`
   - Common utilities and hooks in `lib/` and `hooks/`
   - Consistent TypeScript configuration
   - Shared design system and standards

3. **Easier Refactoring**

   - Can refactor across service boundaries in single commits
   - Better IDE support with full codebase context
   - Easier to maintain consistency across services

4. **Simplified CI/CD**
   - Single pipeline to manage
   - Can build and test all services together
   - Easier dependency management and versioning

### Service Boundary Organization

The codebase is organized by feature domains:

- **`app/`**: Next.js app router with dynamic routes
- **`components/common/`**: Feature-specific components (issues, projects, teams, etc.)
- **`components/layout/`**: Layout and navigation components
- **`components/ui/`**: Reusable UI primitives
- **`lib/`**: Shared utilities and business logic
- **`store/`**: State management by domain
- **`mock-data/`**: Development data

### Why Not Microservices?

1. **Development Complexity**: Microservices would require multiple repositories, complex orchestration, and service discovery
2. **Over-engineering**: Current team size and application complexity don't justify the overhead
3. **Deployment Complexity**: Would need container orchestration and service mesh
4. **Data Consistency**: Easier to maintain consistency in a single application

### Future Scalability

The monorepo structure allows for future extraction of services when needed:

- Clear service boundaries make it easy to extract services later
- Shared libraries can be published as npm packages
- Can gradually move to microservices if team and complexity grow

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Simplified development and deployment
- ✅ Better code reuse and consistency
- ✅ Easier refactoring and maintenance
- ✅ Single source of truth for dependencies
- ✅ Better IDE support and tooling

### Negative

- ❌ Larger repository size
- ❌ Potential for tight coupling between services
- ❌ Single point of failure for the entire system
- ❌ All services must use the same technology stack

### Mitigation Strategies

- Enforce clear service boundaries through linting rules
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define service contracts
- Implement proper testing to prevent tight coupling
- Consider service extraction when team grows beyond 5-8 developers

## Implementation

The monorepo structure is implemented with:

- **pnpm**: For efficient package management and workspace support
- **Next.js**: As the primary framework with app router
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across all services
- **ESLint/Prettier**: For consistent code formatting
- **Husky**: For pre-commit hooks and quality gates
