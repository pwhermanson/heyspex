<!--DID WORK-->

Terminal is hanging. But that's okay, don't worry about it. Please look at the terminal to confirm that your last command worked. I think it was successful from what I can tell. Please make sure that you don't do the same command again if it worked already. I think it makes sense to proceed with your next steps now.
