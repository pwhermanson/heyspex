Act as a senior refactor engineer: use @refactor-os.md as the rulebook for all refactoring. Load @refactor-plan.md, auto-select the next unchecked task (or the task id set by `next:`), re-validate the plan before any edits, enforce single-task focus, run preflight and phased commits, typecheck and lint with zero new warnings, run build and tests after each change, open a draft PR with evidence and rollback steps, check off the PR checklist in real time, and on completion mark the corresponding plan checkbox to [x] with date, commit sha, and notes.
